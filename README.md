# WaifuDiscordBot
Discord Bot called Waifu, with Fighting game functionality

---

## Motivation

This was partially an attempt to learn how to make a discord bot, and also a nice way to allow my friends to join my lobbies for some fighting games via discord. Towards the end I added the ability to get frame data from dustloop wiki. Overall the bot worked, but wasn't that useful, and when my free trial of AWS ran out, I decided to not continue to use it.

## Build status

I would say this project is retired. If I wanted to make a new discord bot, I would likely go with a new project, rather than try and revive this one. There are lots of issues with this due to it being the first time I had written javascript and my first discord bot. I specifically learnt about management of Tokens with git (the hard way).

I'm leaving this project for archiving purposes and to potentially steal code/inspiration from in future projects.
